# The "Guess - A - Number" Game

### Project goals
The goal of the project is to create a console game called "Guess - A - Number". It is a game in which your opponent (the computer) chooses a random number between 1 and 100 and your task is to guess this number. After each number you enter, the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected until you guess the correct number.

### Algorithm
At the beginning of the game you have to choose the game's difficulty which is easy,medium or hard.Depending on what you choose you will have a certain number of tries to guess the number during the game.If you guess the number the level of the game increases by 1 and the range of possible numbers generated by the computer increases by 10.

If you fail to guess the number and reach the maximum number of tries the game ends.The player can choose to continue playing or quit.
